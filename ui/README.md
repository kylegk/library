# Angular Library Manager UI

This application provides a simple web UI for managing a collection of books. It provides functionality for adding, editing, updating, and viewing the books in the collection.

## Getting Started

The application is backed using the Nest.js API found in the `/app` subdirectory in the root of this project. In order to use any of the functionality of this application, you must ensure that the API and database are also running.

Please see the documentation in the README.md file found in the root of this project for how to start both the API and this web UI.

## TODO

This application is by no means considered feature complete. As called out in the documentation for the API this application consumes, features such as the ability to refresh the JWT and pagination have not yet been implemented.
